Setting a scraper’s scheduler
=============================

You can schedule a scraper’s scheduler in as granular detail as you want. However, we only support granularity down to the Minute.
We currently support the CRON syntax for scheduling.
You can set the ‘schedule’ field or the ‘timezone’ to specify the timezone when the job will be started. If timezone is not specified, it will default to “UTC”. Timezone values are IANA format. Please see the list of available timezones.
The scheduler also has the option to cancel current job, anytime it starts a new one. By default a scraper’s scheduler does not start a new job if there is an already existing job that is active.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper create <scraper_name> <git_repo> --schedule "0 1 * * * *" --timezone "America/Toronto" --cancel-current-job
   $ answersengine scraper update <scraper_name> --schedule "0 1 * * * *" --timezone "America/Toronto"

The following are allowed CRON values:

+--------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+
| Field Name   | Mandatory? | Allowed Values  | Allowed Special Characters |
+==============+============+=================+============================+
| Minutes      | Yes        | 0-59            | \* / , -                   |
+--------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+
| Hours        | Yes        | 0-23            | \* / , -                   |
+--------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+
| Day of month | Yes        | 1-31            | \* / , - L W               |
+--------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+
| Month        | Yes        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | \* / , -                   |
+--------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+
| Day of week  | Yes        | 0-6 or SUN-SAT  | \* / , - L #               |
+--------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+
| Year         | No         | 1970–2099       | \* / , -                   |
+--------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+

| Asterisk ( * )
| The asterisk indicates that the cron expression matches for all values of the field. E.g., using an asterisk in the 4th field (month) indicates every month.

| Slash ( / )
| Slashes describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the minute field indicate the third minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form \*/... is equivalent to the form "first-last/...", that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field.

| Comma ( , )
| Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using MON,WED,FRI in the 5th field (day of week) means Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

| Hyphen ( - )
| Hyphens define ranges. For example, 2000-2010 indicates every year between 2000 and 2010 AD, inclusive.

| L
| L stands for "last". When used in the day-of-week field, it allows you to specify constructs such as "the last Friday" (5L) of a given month. In the day-of-month field, it specifies the last day of the month.

| W
| The W character is allowed for the day-of-month field. This character is used to specify the business day (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify 15W as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: "the nearest business day to the 15th of the month."

So, if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger fires on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger fires on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it fires on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify 1W as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger fires on Monday the 3rd, as it does not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days.

The W character can be specified only when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.

The W character can also be combined with L, i.e. LW to mean "the last business day of the month."

| Hash ( # )
| # is allowed for the day-of-week field, and must be followed by a number between one and five. It allows you to specify constructs such as "the second Friday" of a given month.

Changing a Scraper’s or a Job’s Proxy Type
==========================================

We support many types of proxies to use:

+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Proxy Type             | Description                                                                                                                             |
+========================+=========================================================================================================================================+
| standard               | The standard rotating proxy that gets randomly used per request. This is the default.                                                   |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper update <scraper_name> --proxy-type sticky1

Keep in mind that the above will only take effect when a new scrape job is created.

To change a proxy of an existing job, first cancel the job, and then change the proxy_type, and then resume the job:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper job cancel <scraper_name>
   $ answersengine scraper job update <scraper_name> --proxy-type sticky1
   $ answersengine scraper job resume <scraper_name>

Setting a specific ruby version
===============================

By default our ruby version that we use is 2.4.4, however if you want to specify a different ruby version you can do so by creating a .ruby-version file on the root of your project directory.

NOTE: we currently only allow the following ruby versions:

* 2.4.4
* 2.5.3
* If you need a specific version other than these, please let us know

Setting a specific Ruby Gem
===========================

To add dependency to your code, we use Bundler. Simply create a Gemfile on the root of your project directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ echo "gem 'roo', '~> 2.7.1'" > Gemfile
   $ bundle install # this will create a Gemfile.lock
   $ ls -alth | grep Gemfile
   total 32
   -rw-r--r--   1 johndoe  staff    22B 19 Dec 23:43 Gemfile
   -rw-r--r--   1 johndoe  staff   286B 19 Dec 22:07 Gemfile.lock
   $ git add . # and then you should commit the whole thing into Git repo
   $ git commit -m 'added Gemfile'
   $ git push origin

Changing a Scraper’s Standard worker count
==========================================

The more workers you use on your scraper, the faster your scraper will be.
You can use the command line to change a scraper’s worker count:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper update <scraper_name> --workers N

Keep in mind that this will only take effect when a new scrape job is created.

Changing a Scraper’s Browser worker count
=========================================

The more workers you use on your scraper, the faster your scraper will be.
You can use the command line to change a scraper’s worker count:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper update <scraper_name> --browsers N

NOTE: Keep in mind that this will only take effect when a new scrape job is created.

Changing an existing scrape job’s worker count
==============================================

You can use the command line to change a scraper job’s worker count:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper job update <scraper_name> --workers N --browsers N

This will only take effect if you cancel, and resume the scrape job again:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper job cancel <scraper_name> # cancel first
   $ answersengine scraper job resume <scraper_name> # then resume

Enqueueing a page to Browser Fetcher’s queue
============================================

You can enqueue a page like so in your script. The following will enqueue a headless browser:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     fetch_type: "browser" # This will enqueue headless browser
   }

Or use the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --fetch-type browser

You can enqueue a page like so in your script. The following will enqueue a full browser (non-headless):

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     fetch_type: "fullbrowser" # This will enqueue headless browser
   }

Or use the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --fetch-type fullbrowser

Setting fetch priority to a Job Page
====================================

The following will enqueue a higher priority page.
NOTE: You can only create a page that has priority, not update an existing page with a new priority value on the script. Also, updating a priority only works via the command line tool.

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     priority: 1 # defaults to 0. Higher numbers means will get fetched sooner
   }

Or use the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --priority N
   $ answersengine scraper page update <job> <gid> --priority N

Setting a user-agent-type of a Job Page
=======================================

You can enqueue a page like so in your script:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     ua_type: "desktop" # defaults to desktop, other available is mobile.
   }

Or use the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --ua-type mobile

Setting the request method of a Job Page
========================================

You can enqueue a page like so in your script:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     method: "POST" # defaults to GET.
   }

Or use the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --method GET

Setting the request headers of a Job Page
=========================================

You can enqueue a page like so in your script:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     headers: {"Cookie": "name=value; name2=value2; name3=value3"} # set this
   }

Or use the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --headers '{"Cookie": "name=value; name2=value2; name3=value3"}'

Setting the request body of a Job Page
======================================


You can enqueue a page like so in your script:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     body: "your request body here" # set this field
   }

Or use the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --body 'your request body here'

Setting the page_type of a Job Page
===================================

You can enqueue a page like so in your script:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     page_type: "page_type_here" # set this field
   }

Or use the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --page-type page_type_here

Reset a Job Page
================

You can reset a scrape-job page’s parsing and fetching from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page reset <scraper_name> <gid>

You can also reset a page from any parser or seeder script by setting the `reset` field to true while enqueueing it, like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     reset: true # set this field
   }

Handling cookies
================

There are two ways to handle cookies in Fetch, at a lower level via the Request and Response Headers, or at a higher level via the Cookie Jar.

Low level cookie handling using Request/Response Headers
--------------------------------------------------------

To handle cookie at a lower level, you can set the “cookie” on the request header:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     headers: {"Cookie": "name=value; name2=value2; name3=value3"},
   }

You can also read cookies by reading the “Set-Cookie” response headers:

.. code-block:: ruby

   page['response_headers']['Set-Cookie']

High level cookie handling using the Cookie Jar
-----------------------------------------------

To handle cookie at a higher level, you can set the “cookie” field directly onto the page, and it will be saved onto the Cookie Jar during that request.

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     cookie: "name=value; name2=value2; name3=value3",
   }

You can also do so from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --cookie "name=value; name2=value2"

You can then read the cookie from the cookiejar by:

.. code-block:: ruby

   page['response_cookie']

This method above is reading from the cookiejar. This is especially useful when a cookie is set by the target-server during redirection.

Force Fetching a specific unfresh page
======================================

To enqueue a page and have it force fetch, you need to set freshness field, and force_fetch field. Freshness should only be now, or in the past. It cannot be in the future. Basically it is “how much time ago, that you consider this page as fresh”
One thing to keep in mind, that this only resets the page fetch, it does nothing to your parsing of pages, whether the parser has executed or not.
In your parser script you can do the following:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     freshness: "2018-12-12T13:59:29.91741Z", # has to be this string format
     force_fetch: true
   }

You can do this to find one output result or use the command line to query an output:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --page-type page_type_here --force-fetch --freshness "2018-12-12T13:59:29.91741Z"

Handling JavaScript
===================

To do javascript rendering, please use the Browser Fetcher.
First you need to add a browser worker onto your scraper:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper update <scraper_name> --browsers 1

Next, for every page that you add, you need to specify the correct fetch_type:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper page add <scraper_name> <url> --fetch-type browser

Or in the script, by doing the following:

.. code-block:: ruby

   pages << {
     url: "http://test.com",
     fetch_type: "browser"
   }

Doing dry-run of your script locally
====================================

Using the `try` command will allow you dry-run a parser or a seeder script locally. How it works is, it downloads necessary data from the Fetch cloud, and then executes your script locally, but it does not upload any data back to the Fetch Cloud.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine parser try ebay parsers/details.rb
   $ answersengine seeder try ebay seeder/seeder.rb

Executing your script locally, and uploading to Fetch
=====================================================

Using the `exec` command will allow you execute a parser or a seeder script locally and upload the result to the Fetch cloud. It works by downloading the necessary data from the Fetch cloud, and executes it locally. When done it will upload the resulting output and pages back onto the Fetch cloud.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine parser exec <scraper_name> <parser_file> <gid>
   $ answersengine seeder exec <scraper_name> <seeder_file>

The `exec` command is really useful to do end-to-end testing on your script, to ensure that not only the execution works, but also if it properly uploads the resulting data to the Fetch cloud.
Any errors that are generated during the exec command, will be logged onto the Fetch cloud’s log, so it is accessible in the following way

.. code-block:: bash

   $  answersengine scraper log <scraper_name>
   $  answersengine scraper page log <scraper_name> <gid>

Once you’ve successfully executed the command locally using `exec` you can check your stats, and collection lists and outputs using the command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper stats <scraper_name>
   $ answersengine scraper output collection <scraper_name>
   $ answersengine scraper output list <scraper_name> --collection <collection_name>

Querying scraper outputs
========================

We currently support the ability to query a scraper outputs based on arbitrary JSON key. Only exact matches are currently supported.
In your parser script you can do the following to find many output results:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # find_outputs(collection='default', query={}, page=1, per_page=30)
   # will return an array of output records
   records = find_outputs('foo_collection', {"_id":"123"}, 1, 500}

Or you can do this to find one output result:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # find_output(collection='default', query={})
   # will return one output record
   record = find_output('foo_collection', {"_id":"123"}}

Or use the command line, to query an output:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper output list <scraper_name> --collection home --query '{"_id":"123"}'

You can also query outputs from another scraper or job:
To find output from another job, do the following:

.. code-block:: ruby

   records = find_outputs('foo_collection', {"_id":"123"}, 1, 500, job_id: 1234}

To find output from another scraper, do the following:

.. code-block:: ruby

   records = find_outputs('foo_collection', {"_id":"123"}, 1, 500, scraper_name:'my_scraper'}

Restart a scraping job
======================

To restart a job, you need to cancel an existing job first, then start a new one:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ answersengine scraper job cancel <scraper_name>
   $ answersengine scraper start <scraper_name>

Using a custom docker image for the scraper
===========================================

We support docker image where the scraper will run on. What this means, is that you can install any dependencies that you’d like on it. Please let the AnswersEngine support know so that this can be created for you.


IMPORTANT: Only docker images that are compatible with Fetch can be run. Please contact us for more info.

Our base Docker image is based on Alpine 3.7:

.. code-block:: ruby

   FROM alpine:3.7

So, if you want a package to be installed, make sure that it builds correctly on your local machine first.

Once correctly built, please let us know what dockerfile commands to add to the custom image.
The following format would be preferable:

.. code-block:: bash

   RUN apk add --update libreoffice

Once we have built the image for you, you can use this custom image by modifying your config.yaml file and include the following line:

.. code-block:: bash

   scraper_image: <url-to-your-docker-image>

When you have modified this and deploy this, you need to restart your job.

Advanced Usage
==============

Parsing Failed Responses
------------------------

Fetch comes with a lot of safety harnesses to make scraping easy and delightful for developers. What this means is, we only allow for successfully fetched pages to be parsed.
However, if you do need to go down into the detail and deal with your own failed pages, or other type of responses, we allow you to do so.
On your config.yaml, add the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

   parse_failed_pages: true

After doing the above, don’t forget to deploy your scraper, and restart your job.

We have now removed your safety harnesses.
From now on, you have to deal with your own page reset, and page response statuses.
Typically, you should have your parser deal with two kinds of responses, successful and failed ones.
Look at the following example parser file on how we deal with the different responses in the same parser:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if page['response_status_code'] # if response is successful
      body = Nokogiri.HTML(content)
   elsif page['failed_response_status_code'] # if response is not successful
      body = Nokogiri.HTML(failed_content)
   end

   doc = {
      text: body.text,
      url: page['url']
   }

   outputs << doc
